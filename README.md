## Planning Story

The idea for this application sprouted as I was staring at my plants while talking with my housemate about what I should make as my *very first* full-stack application for the second project in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. My housemates and I **LOVE** plants and excitement buzzes in our home after runs to our favorite plant store together as a household. We'd often ask each other if we know what a specific plant needs in terms of soil, sunlight, and watering on top of our own research compilations. I thought it would be a great idea if all the plants and each of their care instructions were located in one place.

I planned to and was able to follow the suggested schedule and general steps given by the instructors to download the API and browser templates, build the API, and then build the front-end application. I successfully built the API much quicker than I had originally planned, giving me more time with the front-end, which is where I ran into a couple of bumps like some of my punny user feedback messages not showing, modal backdrops remaining after a successful submit, and others. My approach to problem solving included talking aloud through the problem, trying to explain and walk myself/someone else through my problem, Googling, lots of trial and error just to see if something does or doesn't do anything, and even walking away from the screen for a little bit.
